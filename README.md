# Election2020

## About
I developed a [website](https://FortyTwoFortyTwo.github.io/Election2020/index.html) for Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development Project. The website's goal is to explain the United States 2020 election.
There is also a section for the Georgia Senate Runoff and a contact page to sign up for a newsletter.
The website is designed to be simple and easy to use on any platform or scale. There is a tab menu to switch between pages.

## Deployment

#### Adding and Committing files
To add files to the repository take the following steps

In the command line type -
        git add .  
        git commit -m "This is being committed"
        git push

To add all new files or modified file use " ."  - To add a single file use the pathway to the file eg .index.html  or assets/css/style.css
When committing make sure your comments are clear about what changes have been made. 
Pushing will send your work to the repository

#### Deployment 
The project was deployed with the following steps

* Logged into git hub
* Clicked the "Settings" button in the menu above the Repository.
* Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.
* Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and then select "Master Branch".
* The page will automatically refresh, and a link displaced.  It may take some time for the link to show the website.
* If the page will not load go down to "template" under the "source" and select a template. 
* Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.


#### Forking
By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.  This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.
* You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.
