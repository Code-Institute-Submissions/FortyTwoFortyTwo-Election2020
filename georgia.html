				<h3>Control of Senate</h3>
				<h4>2020 Senate elections were held on Tuesday November 3rd 2020. After the election, Republican held 50 seats, Democratic held 46 seats, 2 Independents who both caucused with the Democratic party, and 2 undecided seats both from Georgia.
				Due to Georgia law, none of the candidates got the majority of the votes in both seats, triggering a runoff election for top 2 candidates on Tuesday January 5th 2021.
				One seat has incumbent Republican David Perdue with Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, while other seat has incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler with Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock.</h4>

				<h3>Control of Senate</h3>
				<h4>Republican currently controls the senate with 50 seats, while challenger Democratic have 48 seats. If Democratic won both Georgia seats, control of the senate would be a 50-50 tie, but Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be able to break the tie to let Democratic control the senate.
				If Republican won one of the seat, they would have atleast 51 seats, able to keep its control of the senate.</h4>
